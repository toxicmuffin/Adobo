# Adobo

## Scope
I saw someone have "buy me a coffee" on their blog and it inspired me to make a one page link page with Ether tipping. Is this viable or a good idea, I don't know, but it was a fun mini project.

***I've only tested this MetaMask. Might add error handling later when a plugin is not present for getAccount and ethereum.request***

***Does not work on mobile***

## Values, Options, Parameters
Value, Gas, Gas Price, and other options are hex encoded. Values are done from Wei to Ether. 1 Ether = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei. This is done for better accuracy.
